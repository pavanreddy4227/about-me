        <p>I have joined in Applied Computer Science course at NWMSU for this fall semester.
                I am from India and  got my Under-Graduation in the field of computer science engineering  from Vignan's university in 2019. As i was a good programmer from my early stage of grad studies i was given an opportunity to work as an intern at  Visual IT Solutions Pvt Limited in my last semester.
                I'm really passionate about  designing web applications ,so I'm looking forward to  work on real-time projects.
